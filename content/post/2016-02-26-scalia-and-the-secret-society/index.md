It was [recently reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-scalia-spent-his-last-hours-with-members-of-this-secretive-society-of-elite-hunters/2016/02/24/1d77af38-db20-11e5-891a-4ed04f4213e8_story.html?utm_term=.b46e7313303e) in the Washington Post that the late Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia had ties to a secret society of hunters called the International Order of St. Hubertus and that several of the guests at the Texas ranch where Scalia died were members of this group.

Surely I'm not the only one that finds this a bit weird. A secret society of hunters? I don't know the first thing about hunting but from I've seen, the only thing secret about hunting is sneaking up on an animal so you can kill it.

No. My guess is that the hunting story is a cover. I'm no conspiracy theorist but I'll bet the real story is closer to the secret society in Kubrik's _"Eyes Wide Shut"_.
