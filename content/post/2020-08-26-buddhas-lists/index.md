Beginning with "The Four Noble Truths"[^1], "The Noble Eightfold Path"[^2], and so on, the Buddha was a list-maker. I recently found a wonderful book, now out of print but freely [available as a pdf](https://www.thedhamma.com/buddhaslists.pdf). By David Snyder, Ph.D., it is called "The Complete Book of Buddha's Lists - Explained"

Snyder does a brilliant job of reinterpreting these lists and framing them in the context of what the social sciences say about how we function individually and in groups.

I was particularly struck by his treatment of The Four Brahmavih훮r훮s, along with their near and far enemies.

| Brahmavih훮r훮s | Meaning | Near enemy | Far enemy |
|---------------|---------|------------|-----------|
| metta | loving-kindness | self-affection | painful ill-will |
| karuna | compassion | pity | cruelty |
| mudita | sympathetic joy | exuberance | resentment |
| upekkha | equanimity | indifference | craving, clinging |

Whether the book is a useful introduction to Buddhist philosophy and practice would be a matter of debate; but for someone who understands its basic tenets, the book is outstanding.

[^1]: _1. It is in the nature of life to suffer. 2. Suffering is caused by desire. 3. Suffering ceases when we let go of desires. 4. There is a process for letting go of desires._ Sometimes I think that the word "desire" is too loaded in English. I like David Snyder's interpretation; he reframes it as "unreasonable expectations."
[^2]: As the name implies, eight practices of mind and being in the world that yield liberation from the suffering caused by desires. An [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path) on the Noble Eightfold Path.
