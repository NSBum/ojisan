### Politicians and dogs

Politicians are well-trained dogs. Our dog trainer once said that "dogs only do what they want to do." By providing an attractive stimulus they will behave in ways that you want them to behave. Dogs like treats. Politicians like power and money. Politicians will only perform tricks for power or money. Want politicians to do something? Reach into your training pouch and bring out some power and money.

### Patience

From _"Bodhisattvacharyavatara"_ (A Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life) by Shantideva. [More on the guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisatt)

_Whatever wholesome deeds, // Such as venerating the Buddhas, and generosity, // That have been amassed over a thousand aeons //Will all be destroyed in one moment of anger._

_There is no evil like hatred, // And no fortitude like patience. // Thus I should strive in various ways // To meditate on patience._
