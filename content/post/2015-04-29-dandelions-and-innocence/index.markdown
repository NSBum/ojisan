Spring has finally arrived in Minnesota. So have dandelions.

On one of our walks, my daughter ViolinGirl exclaimed how much she loved the yellow "daisies" that dot some lawns. She wished our lawn could be covered with these beautiful flowers.

What a strange circumstance! We begin life appreciating the random beauty of these "weeds." But once we reach adulthood, neighborhood peer pressure and cultural expectations have us spraying toxic chemicals - to our own detriment, no less - to eradicate these cherished flowers.

We are selling our house and property located on one such anti-dandelion neighborhood. With it, I'll say goodbye to people who insist that I join them in dandelion genocide. So like the Lorax, I'll say: "Let it grow!"
