It turns out that command line text web browers like [lynx](https://lynx.browser.org/) can bypass AdBlock detection.

On macOS, I installed `lynx` using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Then from the Terminal, it's just `lynx your-url`. It's actually quite pleasant to read text without all of the images and fluff.
