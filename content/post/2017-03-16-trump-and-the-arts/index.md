I've long suspected that Trump regards the arts as an unnecessary nuisance for losers and suckers. High art for this hollow man is the vacuous reality television that made him famous. Now in his Federal budget, [Trump offers proof](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/arts/nea-neh-endowments-trump.html). He proposes the elimination of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

This is a man with no soul.

But in the closing lines of her lyric poem ["Renascence"](http://www.bartleby.com/131/1.html), Edna St. Vincent Millay has a warning:

{{< rawhtml >}}
<div style="font-style: italic; font-size: 18px; font-family: georgia, palatino, 'times new roman'; margin-left:100px;">
The world stands out on either side<br />
No wider than the heart is wide;<br />
Above the world is stretched the sky,—<br />
No higher than the soul is high.<br />
The heart can push the sea and land<br />
Farther away on either hand;<br />
The soul can split the sky in two,<br />
And let the face of God shine through.<br />
But East and West will pinch the heart<br />
That can not keep them pushed apart;<br />
And he whose soul is flat—the sky<br />
Will cave in on him by and by.
</div>

If it's not garish, gold, or glittering, it's not worth our investment. Time for an artist's march.
