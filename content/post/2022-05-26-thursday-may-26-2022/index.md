I would like to propose a constitutional amendment that prohibits Sen. Ted Cruz (F-TX)[^1] from speaking or tweeting for seven days after a national tragedy. I'd also be fine with an amendment that prohibits him from speaking _ever_.

[^1]: The "F" designation stands for _Fascist_. The party to which Cruz nominally belongs is more aligned with WW2-era Axis dictatorships than those of a legitimate free civil democracy.
