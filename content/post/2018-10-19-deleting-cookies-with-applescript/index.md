A couple years ago I [wrote about a method](/2016/01/25/Stop-Facebook-tracking/) for deleting cookies from Safari on macOS by employing AppleScript. Now I have a new script that works on OS X 10.14 Mojave. There are ways of surgically removing cookies, but honestly most sites leave so many cookies on my machine that I have no idea what any of them do and to what extent they use them to track me.

### Safari

Here's the script for Safari. Install it in `~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Safari` (or really, wherever you like.) When launched from the scripts menu in the menu bar, it will close all current tabs and delete every cookie that Safari has saved. Since it employs UI scripting, you'll need to give it accessibility permissions when asked.

### Chrome

In the case of Chrome, it seems to store its cookies in a SQLite database. There, I just delete the database using AppleScript:
