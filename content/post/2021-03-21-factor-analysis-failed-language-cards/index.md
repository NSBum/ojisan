After [developing a rudimentary approach](/2021/03/20/refactoring-anki-language-cards/) to detecting resistant language learning cards in Anki, I began teasing out individual factors. Once I was able to adjust the number of lapses for the age of the card, I could examine the effect of different factors on the difficulty score that I described previously.

### Findings

Some of the interesting findings from this analysis:

- **Prompt-answer direction** - 62% of lapses were in the Russian â†’ English (recognition) direction.[^1]
- **Part of speech** - Over half (51%) of lapses were among verbs. Since the Russian verbal system is rich and complex, it's not surprising to find that verb cards often fail.
- **Noun gender** - Between a fifth and a quarter (22%) of all lapses were among neuter nouns and among failures due to nouns only, neuter nouns represented 69% of all lapses. This, too, makes intuitive sense because neuter nouns often represent abstract concepts that are difficult to represent mentally. For example, the Russian words for _community_, _representation_, and _indignation_ are all neuter nouns.

### Interventions

With a better understanding of the factors that contribute to lapses, it is easier to anticipate failures before they accumulate. For example, I will immediately implement a plan to surround new neuter nouns with a larger variety of audio and sample sentence cards. For new verbs, I'll do the same, ensuring that I include multiple forms of the verb, varying the examples by tense, number, person, aspect and so on.

### Future directions

I'd like to extend this approach to a more statistically-rigorous prediction scheme, so that I can more accurately target efforts to prevent the accumulation of lapses.

[^1]: Note that the fractions in the `fx all lapses` column for the card direction group do not add up to 1.0 because I excluded a minute number of image cards from the analysis.
