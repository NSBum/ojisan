As a largely self-directed second language learner, I'm always on the lookout for new ways to improve my effectiveness. I recently ran across [this excellent little book](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/about/staff/publications/paul-nation/foreign-language_1125.pdf) by [Professor Paul Nation](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/about/staff/paul-nation), an emeritus professor of lingusitics at [Victoria University of Queensland](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/explore/study-areas/linguistics/overview)

If you're learning a foreign language, [this book](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/about/staff/publications/paul-nation/foreign-language_1125.pdf) will definitely help shape your studies.
