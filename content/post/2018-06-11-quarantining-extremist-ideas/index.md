This is an interesting [essay](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/01/extremist-ideas-media-coverage-kkk) in _The Guardian_ on the idea of quarantining extremist ideas.

A non-trivial proportion of the population regards the media as having a responsibility to represent all idea with equal validity. So the appearance of extremist ideas in the press, even if they are treated negatively, results in more legitimacy than they are due. The authors in this essay make a case for quarantining these extreme ideas, refusing to cover them. Strategic silence, they call it.

If I were to implement this, anything Trump writes on Twitter would be quarantined because social media is not a platform for deliberate thought and government policy.
