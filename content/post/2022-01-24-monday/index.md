### Soviet maps of UK and North America

This is from an [interesting collection of maps](https://redatlasbook.com/) of the UK and North American cities produced by the Soviet Union.  You can [search](https://sovid.redatlasbook.com) for maps of particular locations.

[What we learned about each other](https://www.politicalorphans.com/what-we-learned-about-each-other/)

> What I hate most about the past half decade is what we learned about each other. Call me naive, but I never imagined that uncles, cousins and friends I loved and respected would so effortlessly embrace Fascism. I never imagined they would elevate some TV conman to a deity.

We progressives are implored to initiate important conversations with "the other side" but this is contingent on truth-seeking and an effort to shed biases. I encounter very few Republicans who show a willingness dispassionately try to get to the truth. (No small number of "woke" progressives also manifest this tendency, too, to be fair.)

My rules for social media:

1. Look at Facebook once a month on the first day of the month. Check any personal messages, and get out.
2. Only check Twitter for one specific user who posts data on the Covid-19 pandemic. Never post anything on Twitter. Never read political posts. Get in and get out quickly.
3. Never look at Instagram. I'm 16 months out from getting away from that platform.
