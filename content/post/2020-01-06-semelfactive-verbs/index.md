Today, working through a text on Russian grammar, I ran across a linguistics term I had not previously encountered.

{{< blockquote author="Terence Wade" source="A Comprehensive Russian grammar" >}}Other **semelfactives** include...{{< /blockquote >}}

It turns out that a [semelfactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semelfactive) is a type of verbal aspect that describes a particular kind of action that is incorporated into the verb's root, not by inflection of the verb. Semelfactives have the following characteristics:

- **Punctuality** - The action is instantaneous, requiring only a moment of time.
- **Perfective** - The action being described is complete; and the focus is on completion.
- **Atelic**^[[Telicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telicity) itself an interesting concept. It's not completely clear how to distinguish between telicity and the concept of verbal aspect, which is so important in Russian. An atelic verb, like a perfective verb, describes an action that has been completed.] - There is no end of the action.

In Russian, semelfactives include: {{< russian >}}крикнуть{{< /russian >}}, {{< russian >}}махнуть{{< /russian >}}, and {{< russian >}}плюнуть{{< /russian >}}.
