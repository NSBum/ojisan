Given my obsession with kimchi, I sometimes wonder whether the salt in kimchi promotes hypertension. The good [news](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352618114000055) seems to be that it doesn't.

In a retrospective recall study^[Consumption of kimchi, a salt fermented vegetable, is not associated with hypertension prevalence, Song, Hong Ji et al., Journal of Ethnic Foods , Volume 1 , Issue 1 , 8 - 12] of over 20,000 Korean adults, there was no association between kimchi consumption and the prevalence of hypertension.
