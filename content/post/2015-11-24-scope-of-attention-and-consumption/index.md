I have a hypothesis. The wider the scope of your attention to social media and the popular press the more material goods you consume.

Having had too many hobbies and pursuits in my own life, I've noticed that the more diverse my attention, the more I ended up consuming. Is it that one's physical environment (how much stuff you buy and surround yourself with) reflects your mental environment? Or is it the other way around? Maybe it's really _both_. The less focused you are on meaningful, low consumption pursuits, the more you buy; and the more you buy, the more distracted you are by all the stuff around you. A vicious circle.

Fortunately, there's a better version - the virtuous circle. The less you own, the less distracted you are and the more likely you are to focus your time and energy on what's important.
