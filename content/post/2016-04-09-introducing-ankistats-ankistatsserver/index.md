The spaced repetition software system [Anki]() is the _de facto_ standard for foreign language vocabulary learning. Its algorithm requires lots of performance data to schedule flashcards in the most efficient way. Anki displays these statistics in a group of thorough and informative statistical graphs and descriptive text.

However, they aren't easily available for the end-user to export. Thus, the reason behind the companion projects [AnkiStats](https://github.com/NSBum/AnkiStats) and [AnkiStatsServer](https://github.com/NSBum/AnkiStatsServer).

The premise is that you can run your own more extensive experiments and statistical tests on the data once you have it in hand. A bit of technical expertise is needed to get it operational but if you are up to it, clone the github repos above and go for it.
