A [brutal piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/opinion/trump-hitler-europe.html) on Trump from the New York Times.

> There are plenty of examples these days, from Moscow to Budapest, of how “democracies” can be manipulated to the point where they can yield only one result. This is Trump’s objective, and for it he needs a weakened Justice Department, a weakened press and an American public that will believe anything. He has had setbacks but is stubborn.

Trump's toolkit is familiar. In it are the tools of every authoritarian brute everywhere. Americans are better than this, though.
