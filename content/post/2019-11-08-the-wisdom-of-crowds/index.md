One of the favourite mantras of the techno-optimist is that "the wisdom of crowds will save us." That with a million collective inputs, we will find solutions that make the world a better place.

Is this true?

Why is it that _wisdom_ and not _madness_ is the state of crowds? There are too many examples of foolishness in crowds. I don't think we can have the wisdom of crowds without their madness.
