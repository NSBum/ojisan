First, I've only seen this syntax referred to as "TK constructions" in [one place](https://www.alphadictionary.com/rusgrammar/tk.html) and it seems that it's not really referred to that way elsewhere.

What's so interesting about this construction?

It's this: in English we can say "We were talking about what you wanted." But in Russian, you can't glue the phrases together that readily. "what" must be in the prepositional case ({{< russian >}}о том{{< /russian >}}) for the sake of the first clause, but it also has to function as a direct object of {{< russian >}}хотела{{< /russian >}}. Since it can't exist in two cases at one, we have to glue it together somehow. That's what this construction does.

The way we do that is like this: {{< russian >}}Мы говорили о том, что ты хотела.{{< /russian >}}

Many prepositions will require this type of construction. For example:

{{< russian >}}Наше решение зависит от того, что он хочет.{{< /russian >}} (_"Our decision depends on what he wants."_)

These constructions can get quite complicated with two prepositions in two different clauses referring to the same thing appearing in two different cases. For example:

{{< russian >}}Мы думали о том, на чём вы вчера настаивали.{{< /russian >}} (_"We were thinking about what you were insisting on yesterday."_)
