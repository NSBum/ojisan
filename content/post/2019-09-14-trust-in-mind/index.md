Listening to a series of excellent dharma talks from the San Francisco Zen Center, I first learned about the ancient poem "Trust in Mind"^[[Full text](https://terebess.hu/english/hsin.html) of the poem, _"Xinxinming"_.] by the Third Ancestor of the Zen tradition, Jianzhi Sengcan (鑑智僧璨)

It captures beautifully, even in translation, the essence of Zen.

{{< blockquote author="Sengcan (鑑智僧璨)" source="Xinximing, Trust in Mind">}}_"The Perfect Way is only difficult for those who pick and choose;<br>
Do not like, do not dislike; all will then be clear.<br>
Make a hairbreadth difference, and Heaven and Earth are set apart;<br>
If you want the truth to stand clear before you, never be for or against."_
