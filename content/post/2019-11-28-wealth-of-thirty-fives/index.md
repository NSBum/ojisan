This is a very interesting set of data points. It looks at the % of assets held by different generations of Americans at the time when the average age of that group was 35 year-old. In other words, when the baby boomers were 35 years-old, on average, they held 21% of the wealth in the U.S. The average age of millenials will be 35 years in another 3 years, but the currently hold only 3% of the U.S. wealth.

It is interesting to speculate on how much political destabilization this will cause, but it will be significant. There is no way that the millenials will put up with a seven-fold loss of assets compared to the boomer generation.
