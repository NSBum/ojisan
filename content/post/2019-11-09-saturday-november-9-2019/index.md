[Word has it](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-idUSKBN1XI1UG) that Trump might want to attend the Victory Day military parade in Moscow. Это наша победа - "This is our victory!" has never seemed more fitting.

Trump has no idea about the cultural significance of {{< russian >}}День победы{{< /russian >}} in Russia. It is a cultural holiday of greatest significance to former Soviet Union. It is a **patriotic** holiday; but the President of the United States should shy away from celebrating the patriotism of another country. It is their private celebration.
