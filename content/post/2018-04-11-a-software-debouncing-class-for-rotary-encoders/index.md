Rotary encoders are notoriously difficult to get right.

Although I haven't used this new encoder class yet, it looks very interesting. From active
Teensy forum user _Theremingenieur_, it allows initialization with upper and/or lower limits.

You can find the code in [this thread](https%3A%2F%2Fforum.pjrc.com%2Fthreads%2F44592-Encoders-%28once-more%29%3Fp%3D145056%26viewfull%3D1%23post145056).
