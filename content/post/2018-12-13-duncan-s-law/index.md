Trump lawyer and all-around whackadoodle Rudy Guiliani claims he's the most ethical person ever. Of course, his association with one of the _least_ ethical people ever suggests otherwise. Thus, it prompts me to articulate "Duncan's Law." Succinctly stated, if someone claims absolute superiority in some particular characteristic, his actual performance in that characteristic is actually somewhere between average and the least performant.
