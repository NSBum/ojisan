> "Every person passing through this life will unknowingly leave something and take something away. Most of this “something” cannot be seen or heard or numbered or scientifically detected or counted. It’s what we leave in the minds of other people and what they leave in ours. Memory. The census doesn’t count it. Nothing counts without it." - Robert Fulghum _All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten_

Maybe buildings, golf resorts, "reality TV" shows, [steaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyONt_ZH_aw), and airplanes count. I don't know.
