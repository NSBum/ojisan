Since one of the cornerstones of my approach to learning the Russian language has been to track how many words I've learned and their frequencies, I was intrigued by reading the following statistics today:

- The 15 most frequent words in the language account for **25%** of all the words in typical texts.
- The first 100 words account for **60%** of the words appearing in texts.
- **97%** of the words one encounters in a ordinary text will be among the first 4000 most frequent words.

In other words, if you learn the first 4000 words of a language, you'll be able to understand nearly everything.
