Yes. Yes, they've done a fine job for _"you"_. But what about the rest of us? Moreover, what about the _"us"_ in perpetuity, those who will have to deal with the erosion of civic norms?

I'm an atheist, but I'm familiar enough with the Christian canon that this photograph of "President" Trump with "journalist" Sean Hannity reminded me of a verse from the Gospel of Matthew (Chapter 16, verse 26):



> _"For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"_

It seems like we're witnessing the end-game of winner-take-all politics, norms, democracy, decency, and truth be-damned. We're exchanging stability and civic norms for "winning."
