Politico has a [piece](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/12/trump-storms-statements-817202) today about Trump's outrageous claims in the face of weather disasters. In almost every context, he reveals himself to be an abject fool; but lurking beneath that idiocy is another layer of loathsomeness - the complete lacking in understanding of science. I want a reporter to ask him any of the following questions about hurricanes:

- _"Mr. Trump, can you describe for us your understanding of how hurricanes form?"_
- _"What role do Coriolis forces play in the formation of tropical cyclones."_
- _"Given that hurricanes possess massive amounts of energy, what are the sources of that energy?"_

[An article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/well/family/why-you-should-stop-yelling-at-your-kids.html) from the _Times_ on why yelling at children is comparable to physical punishment. Children who are subjected to yelling have lower self-esteem, and more depressive and anxiety symptoms.^[The article cites a [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.12143) that shows a reciprocal amplifying effect of yelling and behavioural problems: _"Mothers’ and fathers’ harsh verbal discipline at age 13 predicted an increase in adolescent conduct problems and depressive symptoms between ages 13 and 14. A child effect was also present, with adolescent misconduct at age 13 predicting increases in mothers’ and fathers’ harsh verbal discipline between ages 13 and 14."_]
