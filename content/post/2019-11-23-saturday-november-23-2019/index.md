[Belief is not required](http://hardcorezen.info/belief/6608). My thoughts exactly about Zen. It's not necessary that you _believe_ in anything. A spirit of inquiry and open-hearted skepticism pervades Zen.

["She didn't hang my picture"](https://politicalwire.com/2019/11/22/trump-claims-yovanovitch-refused-to-hang-his-picture/). I'm trying to be more compassionate about Donald Trump. The deep psychic wounds that would cause a 73 year-old man to behave like a needy, abandoned child must be very painful.
