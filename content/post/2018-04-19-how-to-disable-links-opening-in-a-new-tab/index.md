One of the most infuriating UX choices on the web is the developer's choice to open _every single link_ in a new tab. There are a few sites I interact with, including Aliexpress, where the designers have inflicted this on the users.

Fortunately, I found a solution. The Chrome extension [target="_blank"-toggler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/targetblank-toggler/emjjmkkcdllendgbldliiphlbpnomnjk) works well. When you hover over a link which would open in a new tab, it superimposes a visual signal. Now you have a choice. If you click on the link, it will open in a new tab. If you `Command` + Shift click,^[The ⌘ + ⇧ combination works on macOS. It is probably CONTROL + Shift on Windows, but you'll have to check the documentation.] the link will open in the same tab. Problem solved.
