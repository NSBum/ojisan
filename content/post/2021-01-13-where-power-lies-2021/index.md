From an [article](https://www.bbc.com/russian/news-55643022) recently on the [BBC Russian Service](https://www.bbc.com/russian):

> {{< russian >}}Блокировка уходящего президента США в "Твиттере" и "Фейсбуке" привела к необычной ситуации: теоретически Трамп еще может начать ядерную войну, но не может написать твит.{{< /russian >}}

_"Blocking the outgoing U.S. President from Twitter and Facebook has led to an unusual situation: theoretically Trump can still start a nuclear war, but cannot write a Tweet."_

In only a week, he won't be able to do either. But while celebrating the deplatforming of this vicious clown, I have a tinge of worry about why it means for the future of democracy. It nearly goes without saying that social networks have become nearly the de facto equals of representative government in the U.S.
