An [interesting perspective](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/opinion/the-right-way-to-resist-trump.html) on resisting Trump by focusing on policy and not personality:

> _"The Italian experience provides a blueprint for how to defeat Mr. Trump. Only two men in Italy have won an electoral competition against Mr. Berlusconi: Romano Prodi and the current prime minister, Matteo Renzi (albeit only in a 2014 European election). Both of them treated Mr. Berlusconi as an ordinary opponent. They focused on the issues, not on his character. In different ways, both of them are seen as outsiders, not as members of what in Italy is defined as the political caste."_

> _"And an opposition focused on personality would crown Mr. Trump as the peopleâ€™s leader of the fight against the Washington caste. It would also weaken the opposition voice on the issues, where it is important to conduct a battle of principles."_

Focus on issues and principles, not personality. [Don't feed the troll](/2017/02/05/Don-t-feed-the-troll/)
