Memorization has a bad reputation in education today, but it underpins the abilities of all sorts of high-performing people. I often refer to [this](https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/20rules) article from 1999 about how to better organize information for memorization.

My favorite pieces of advice:

- Do not learn (memorize) if you do not understand.
- Stick to the minimum information principle.
- Use imagery
- Avoid sets and enumerations
- Use mnemonic techniques.
