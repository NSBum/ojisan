[This piece](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/the-cruelty-is-the-point/572104/) in _The Atlantic_ by Adam Serwer is a reminder that for Trump's supporters, cruelty isn't just a side-effect of Trumpism. It's a feature. That the current U.S. president chose to mock the victim of a sexual assault by a Supreme Court nominee is hardly surprising. But what little hope I had for Trump supporters, particularly those at the Mississippi rally who joined Trump in his mockery, is gone.

> "Trumpâ€™s only true skill is the con; his only fundamental belief is that the United States is the birthright of straight, white, Christian men, and his only real, authentic pleasure is in cruelty. It is that cruelty, and the delight it brings them, that binds his most ardent supporters to him, in shared scorn for those they hate and fear: immigrants, black voters, feminists, and treasonous white men who empathize with any of those who would steal their birthright."

How can the educational system have failed so miserably than to allow the ignorant to wallow in their own ignorance and bigotry? The South is the home of millions of adherents, faithful in word, at least, to a religion of kindness, meekness and tolerance. Yet the Venn circles of evangelicals and Trump supporters is near complete. The hypocrisy is nearly palpable.
