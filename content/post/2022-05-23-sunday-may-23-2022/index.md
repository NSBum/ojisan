[We are all confident idiots](https://psmag.com/social-justice/confident-idiots-92793) - David Dunning (of the Dunning-Kruger effect) in this 2014 article discusses the effect and gives some interesting narrative commentary.

> An ignorant mind is precisely not a spotless, empty vessel, but one thatâ€™s filled with the clutter of irrelevant or misleading life experiences, theories, facts, intuitions, strategies, algorithms, heuristics, metaphors, and hunches that regrettably have the look and feel of useful and accurate knowledge.

[Improving the efficiency](2022/05/19/hugo-static-site-upload-woes-and-a-way-forward/) of [Hugo static site deployment](2022/05/19/hugo-static-site-upload-woes-and-a-way-forward/) to S3. I'm really proud of this solution to a vexing problem. My upload sites for this site and now around 45 seconds are less compared to 10 minutes previously.
