### Facebook is a right-wing company

Jacob Silverman's [piece on Facebook as a right-wing company](https://thebaffler.com/the-future-sucked/all-right-already-silverman) in The Baffler is pretty damning. Just this week, Facebook conferred trusted status on Breitbart, the Nazi lie-peddling rag. Facebook gladly accepts ad revenue from politicians like Trump and friends who purposely lie to pander to ignoramuses in their base. As Silverman points out, there is no longer any neutrality. Zuckerberg has declared that he and his company are instruments of the right-wing.

Personally, it's going to be hard to go back. I don't know that I will. No interaction with Facebook for a month. I suppose I'll stick with my plan of quietly checking it out on the first of the month, once a month. And that's it.
