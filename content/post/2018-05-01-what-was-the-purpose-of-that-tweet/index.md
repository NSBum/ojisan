The thriving New York Times just published a [list of questions](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/us/politics/questions-mueller-wants-to-ask-trump-russia.html) being posed by Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III. What I found particularly interesting was his question about Trump's intent behind his tweet on May 12, 2017 in which he said: "James Comey better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!"

The question being posed by Mr. Mueller is insightful because it will require Trump to admit to the office of the Special Counsel that he was deliberately attempting to intimidate a party to a Federal investigation.

All in all, there are about 4 dozen questions for Trump, which means at least 48 lies.
