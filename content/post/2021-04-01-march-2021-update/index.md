I've decided to post monthly updates to give myself a little accountability and to remind myself that progress is still possible during these long weird months of isolation - now over a year.

### Physical activity

Empirically I keep noticing a connection between mental health and physical activity, so why do I not consistently act on it? So I set up a 3 month goal around commitment to exercise. As of the end of March 2021, I'm on-track to meet those goals.

- Exercised on 28 days in March
- Aerobic exercise (mostly running and fast walking) for 1,072 minutes
- Running/walking for 90 km (56 miles)
- Did shoulder mobility exercises on 27 days (I have a severely limited range of motion of the left shoulder due to frozen shoulder/impingement syndrome.)
- Lifted weights on 29 days.

### Russian

I studied Russian on all 31 days in March 2021.

- Added 189 new words to my Anki vocabulary deck.
- Added 294 new sentences to my Anki sentence decks.
- Practiced pronunciation for 246 minutes
- Listened to Russian language podcasts or other audio on 22 days

### Reading

Meh. I've gotten behind on this goal.

### Accomplishments

- Successfully completed Tessa's Kiwanis Music Festival videos. - This involved accompanying, recording, editing, uploading and corresponding with the festival organizers.
- Set up a goal-tracking spreadsheet that applies the concept of personal OKR's (Objectives & key results)
- Put in place a successful aerobic exercise program.
- Created a Keyboard Maestro macro that converts Markdown in an Anki field to HTML
