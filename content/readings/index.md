A compilation of books and short works of fiction that I've read by year along with a few comments about each. I have some stretch goals for reading this year.

## 2020

- **The Testaments (Margaret Atwood)** - I had to.
- **Fantasyland: How America Went Haywire: A 500-Year History (Kurt Andersen)** - An exhaustive history of nonsense in the United States. Andersen begins with the hypothesis that America's current state bears the marks of its origin story. The know-it-all nitwit reality-show president is just one aspect of a long line of fantasies in America's history.
- {{< russian >}}Отче наш{{< /russian >}} - a depressing but beautifully written short story from Odessa's Holocaust. I read this in the original Russian; and I want to read more from Valentin Katayev {{< russian >}}(Валентин Катаев){{< /russian >}}
- **College Prep for Musicians: A Comprehensive Guide for Students, Parents, Teachers, and Counselors** - some good advice for students who want to go into music. The sections on mental practice and centering are quite good.
- **The Meritocracy Trap (Daniel Markovits)** - This book helped me understand the degree to which the populist uprising in the U.S. can be traced back to the pernicious effects of meritocracy.
