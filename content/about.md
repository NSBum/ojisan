### Hi

### Frequently given answers

### _What is Ojisan Seiuchi?_

おじさんセイウチ in hiragana, one of the Japanese syllabaries. It means "Uncle Walrus." That's a long story.^[Here's the long story. When I was a kid, our school offered a Russian language class. It was during the Cold War and a Soviet takeover seemed to be on everyone's minds; so why not? In the class, we learned that they call Santa Claus "Дед Мороз" which means "Grandfather Frost." I thought it was a funny name because it sounds like "дядя морж" which means "Uncle Walrus." So there.]

### _What do you do for a living?_
I'm a bon vivant.

### _That's it?_
Of course not.

### _I think I may know you. Are you the guy that...?_
Fine. You really want to know? I'm from Shreveport, Louisiana, USA. But don't hold that against me. I was a student at [Caddo Parish Magnet High School](http://www.loewensteins.org/cpmhs/). I graduated in 1983. After high school, I was a student in the Six Year Accelerated Medical Program at LSUS/LSUMC and earned my M.D. in 1989. I spent several years at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and then at the Mayo Clinic. I left medicine several years ago and worked writing iOS and Mac applications for a while. I live in Canada now.

### _Why do you write so much about U.S. politics if you live in Canada?_
I'm a U.S. citizen and even though I live in Canada, they still make me file taxes in the U.S. So as long as I pay taxes in the U.S. I feel free to vote there and offer my opinions.

### _Can I like you on Facebook?_
<s>No. I'm not on Facebook.</s> As of January 2016, you can find me [there](https://www.facebook.com/ojisan.seiuchi). I eventually gave in and went on Facebook in order to stay in touch with friends and family after a long move.

### _How can I reach you?_
Use my [contact page](http://www.shortwhale.com/NSBum).

### _You write about a lot of stuff. Why?_
I'm opinionated and I don't sleep enough.

### _How can I comment on an article_?

You can't. At least not right now. Why? When I had comments turned on previously, the time spent managing comments was more than I had available. You can contact me as above if you need to.
