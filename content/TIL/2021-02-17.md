A couple of terms that deal with perceptual distortions and cognitive bias:

- **apophenia** - a tendency to see connections between two unrelated things.
- **pareidolia** - the faulty perception of a pattern in an image, e.g. seeing a face in a geologic formation on Mars.

Pareidolia is a specific form of apophenia.
