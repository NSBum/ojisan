[W3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/) has a [CSS library](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_colors.asp) that's quite nice. I often use Bootstrap; but I like some of the visual features here better. For example, I like their [tags](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_tags.asp) because they have more flexible use of colour.

If you want to fetch from a Python dictionary, but you need a default value, this is how you do it:

{{< highlight python >}}
upos_badge = {'noun': 'lime','verb': 'amber', 'adv': 'blue',}
badge_class_postfix = upos_badge.get(value.lower(), 'light-grey')
{{< /highlight >}}

I recently learned about [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com) as an alternative to Google Translate. It seems really good.
